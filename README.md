# Band-Name-Generator.

## ðŸ“š What This Code Does

This small Python program asks the user for two pieces of information:
- The name of the **city** they are from.
- The name of their **pet**.

It then combines these two pieces of information and suggests a **band name** for them.

## ðŸ§© Full Code

```python
print("Let's find you a band name!\n")

city = input("What city are you from?\n")
pet_name = input("What's your pets name?\n")
print("Your band's name is now " + city + " " + pet_name)


Let's find you a band name!

What city are you from?
Joy City
What's your pets name?
Drake
Your band's name is now Joy City Drake
